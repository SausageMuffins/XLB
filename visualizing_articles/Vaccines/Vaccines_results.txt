"The continued growth of JN.1 suggests that it is either more transmissible or better at evading our immune systems," the CDC said

in the update.

Despite its quick growth, the agency said "there is no evidence that JN.1 presents an increased risk to public health relative to other

currently circulating variants," as it does not appear to cause increased severity of illness.

"This variant is spreading very rapidly, but fortunately the current updated vaccine continues to provide good protection against

severe disease and the need to be hospitalized, and it will protect you from dying," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious

The US doesn’t have a system in place to track Covid-19 cases, but wastewater data

suggests that Covid-19 continues to circulate at high levels in the US and there are still

tens of thousands of Covid-19 hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths each week.

During the week ending January 13, there were nearly 31,000 Covid-19 hospitalizations

and more than 1,800 deaths, according to CDC data.

Still, only about 1 in 5 adults and 1 in 9 children have gotten the latest Covid-19 vaccine,

which is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, the CDC estimates.

(CNN) — A shot of the latest Covid-19 vaccine can help cut the chances of getting a

symptomatic infection by half, early data from the US Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention suggests.

Vaccine manufacturers updated their formulations to target the Omicron variant

XBB.1.5, which was the predominant circulating strain for much of 2023. But the new

CDC data shows that the latest vaccines are similarly effective against JN.1, which has

been causing most Covid-19 infections in the United States since late December.
