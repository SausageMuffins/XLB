study, Link-Gelles said. But the CDC plans to continue to monitor the effectiveness of

the latest vaccine, and additional analysis at later dates will help determine how well

vaccines are working to prevent severe disease and how quickly protection may wane.

The US doesn’t have a system in place to track Covid-19 cases, but wastewater data

suggests that Covid-19 continues to circulate at high levels in the US and there are still

tens of thousands of Covid-19 hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths each week.

During the week ending January 13, there were nearly 31,000 Covid-19 hospitalizations

and more than 1,800 deaths, according to CDC data.

Still, only about 1 in 5 adults and 1 in 9 children have gotten the latest Covid-19 vaccine,

which is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, the CDC estimates.

COVID cases are currently elevated in the U.S., along with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

People’s symptoms and severity of illness are more related to their overall health and strength of immunity than to which COVID

variant they have contracted, according to the CDC. (iStock)

"We expected this increase because COVID-19 has had a pattern of increasing and peaking in late summer, and then again

peaking around the new year," the CDC stated.

"Right now, we do not know to what extent JN.1 may be contributing to these increases or possible increases through the rest of

December like those seen in previous years."

The agency also said, "CDC will closely monitor COVID-19 activity and the spread of JN.1."

Still, only about 1 in 5 adults and 1 in 9 children have gotten the latest Covid-19 vaccine,

which is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, the CDC estimates.

By comparison, nearly half of adults and children have gotten the flu vaccine this

season. And a flu season where the vaccine matches the circulating strain with 50%

effectiveness would be considered a really good match, Link-Gelles said.

“There’s never a bad time to get a Covid vaccine,” she said. “Even with relatively low

levels of hospitalization right now … that extra protection is going to go a long way.”

"It always comes down to a risk/beneIt analysis of what you are more afraid of — the vaccine's side effects or the virus itself, which can have long-term side effects in terms of brain fog, fatigue, cough and also heart issues," he said.

"Denying or exaggerating a vaccine's side effects is not good science — nor is underestimating the risks of the virus, especially in high-risk groups," Siegel added.
