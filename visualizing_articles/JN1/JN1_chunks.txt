JN.1 makes up nearly 57% of new Covid-19 cases in the Northeast, according to the

data. Earlier this week, the variant was already dominant in the region, causing about a

third of new infections at the time.

The CDC estimates that prevalence of JN.1 more than doubled in the US between late

November and mid-December. It seems to be getting an assist from holiday travel and

waning immunity.

Variant trackers say they expect JN.1 to become the leading coronavirus variant around

the world in a matter of weeks.

Covid-19 caused 7 hospitalizations for every 100,000 people in the week ending

December 9, accounting for a 3% increase, CDC data shows.

More than three-quarters of US hospital beds are currently in use, which is largely in line

with trends over the past three years since the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the CDC

warns that rising respiratory virus hospitalizations could strain health care resources in

the coming weeks.

New COVID variant JN.1 now comprises up to 30% of US cases: CDC

By Melissa Rudy

Published January 02, 2024

Fox News

The latest variant of the COVID-19 virus, JN.1, is now responsible for an estimated 15% to 29% of cases in the U.S. as of Dec. 8, according to a posted update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

JN.1, which is currently the country’s fastest growing variant, is expected to continue to increase in prevalence among COVID

cases, the CDC stated.

It is very similar to the BA.2.86 variant, which is an omicron subvariant that emerged in August.

"The continued growth of JN.1 suggests that it is either more transmissible or better at evading our immune systems," the CDC said

in the update.

Chunk 10 (Starts at 837):
"The continued growth of JN.1 suggests that it is either more transmissible or better at evading our immune systems," the CDC said

in the update.

Despite its quick growth, the agency said "there is no evidence that JN.1 presents an increased risk to public health relative to other

currently circulating variants," as it does not appear to cause increased severity of illness.

The vaccines, tests and treatments that are currently available are expected to be effective against JN.1.

People’s symptoms and severity of illness are linked more to their overall health and strength of immunity than which COVID variant

they have contracted, according to the CDC.

"We expected this increase because COVID-19 has had a pattern of increasing and peaking in late summer, and then again

peaking around the new year," the CDC stated.

"Right now, we do not know to what extent JN.1 may be contributing to these increases or possible increases through the rest of

December like those seen in previous years."

The agency also said, "CDC will closely monitor COVID-19 activity and the spread of JN.1."
